WDI Project 2: Fantasy EPL Football App

The EPL Fantasy App will be designed as a fantasy football site for the 2015/2016 English Premier League season. Users can create individual profiles, from which they can join a league with other users. Each league will allow users to 'draft' players from a list of eligible players to form a team. Teams within a league will compete on a weekly basis, with points generated for specific offensive and defensive statistics.

Status:
Currently, this application allows users to create accounts (owners), which are authenticated through a password. The application provides two interfaces: one for the administrator/commissioner of the league and one for general owners. The primary difference between these two interfaces is that only the league commissioner can perform CRUD actions for the league. Both user types can perform CRUD actions for their individual 'owner' profiles, including profile photos and additional information. For added color, a full list of eligible players from the 2014/15 season can be accessed as well.
