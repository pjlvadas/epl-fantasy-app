trello board: https://trello.com/b/v0FhW29k/project-2-fantasy-football

The MVP of this application is to allow users to create accounts (owners), which are authenticated through a password. The application shall provide two interfaces: one for the administrator/commissioner of the league, to conduct CRUD actions behind the scnes, and one for owners who only participate in the fantasy league. For added color, the MVP shall include a full list of eligible players to choose from, once teams, rosters, and drafting are implemented.
