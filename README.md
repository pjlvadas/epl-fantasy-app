WDI Project 2: Fantasy EPL Football App

The EPL Fantasy App will be designed as a fantasy football site for the 2015/2016 English Premier League season. Users can create individual profiles, from which they can join a league with other users. Each league will allow users to 'draft' players from a list of eligible players to form a team. Teams within a league will compete on a weekly basis, with points generated for specific offensive and defensive statistics.

The MVP of this application is to allow users to create user accounts (owners), which are authenticated through a password. The application shall provide two interfaces: one for the administrator/commissioner of the league and one for general owners. The primary difference between these two interfaces is that only the league commissioner will be able to enact CRUD actions behind the scenes. For added color, the MVP shall include a full list of eligible players from which to choose.
